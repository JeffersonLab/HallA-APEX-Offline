README for PID Scripts






APEX_PID_check_L.C: PID script for LHRS. Draw cuts for:

- track parameters: $\beta$ (speed) and $\chi^2$ (fit quality of trick)

- target variables: $y_{tg}$,$\theta_{tg}$,$\phi_{tg}$,$\delta p$  

- track projected to scintillators and calorimeters

  - comparison to Energ-weighted position for calorimeters

  - comaparison to position from timing from Scintillators (to be added)

  Current cut levels based on optics run 4774 (negative polairty for LHRS)




APEX_PID_check_R.C: equivalent script for RHRS. Cut levels based on Optics run 4653 (RHRS with negative polarity).
