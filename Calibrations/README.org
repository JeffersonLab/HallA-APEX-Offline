Sub-directories contain calibration and related scripts for different detectors and systems. They may also contain READMEs where suited.


Need to add file_def.h to this directory with a TString, ROOTFILE_DIR, that has the relevant local directory for root files.

e.g.

TString ROOTFILE_DIR = "/home/user/Rootfiles/apex_%d.root";

where %d is the runnumber (this is needed for Load_more_rootfile.C script).
