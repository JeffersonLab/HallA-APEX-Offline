README for optimisation scripts (newer version)


* LOpticsOpt & LOpticsOptScript

LOpticsOpt is a class that handles various aspects of the optimisation:
- reading in data
- producing and calculating chi^2
- plotting optimisation results

LOpticsOptScript: script that executs optimisation for theta, phi or y_tg


* minimiser_comp & plot_min_comp

minimiser_comp.C: designed to cylce through different ROOT minimisers and algorithms for use in optimisation and save results to a text file.

plot_min_comp.py: plots results of minimiser_comp.


* print_DB

scripts used to print chosen order of optics matrix with all possible elements
- e.g. print a 3rd order matrix with all possible elements.


* SieveCheck
SieveCheck.C: prints out theta and phi of sieve holes (for a chosen foil)
- designed to check and ensure same values are used for optimisation and event-cutting
